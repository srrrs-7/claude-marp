# Development Insights

AI-generated insights from `/insights` analysis, triggered automatically on `git push`.

Each entry records observations about the session, patterns, and improvement suggestions.

**Workflow:**
1. Review entries periodically
2. Apply useful suggestions to `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/rules/`, or `.claude/skills/`
3. Delete applied entries (or mark as `[applied]`)
